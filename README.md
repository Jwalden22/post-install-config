After Installing osTicket, I then began the setup of osTicket.  I did this by going to the Admin Panel where I configured different areas of the software.    I setup things like Users, Agents, Roles, Deparments, Teams.   I also configured and defined Help topics and  SLAs (Service Level Agreements).
